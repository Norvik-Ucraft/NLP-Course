## Machine Learning

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.

Using algorithms that itertively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being 
explicitly programmed where to look.

### Supervised Learning
**Supervised learning** algorithms are trained using **labeled** examples, such as an input where the desired output is
known.

The learning algorithm recevies a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs, and the algorithm learns by
comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors. It then modifies the model accordingly.

Supervised learning is commonly used in applications where historical data predicts likely future events.

### Machine Learning Process
1. Data Acquisition - Get your data! Customers, Sensors, etc.
2. Data Cleaning - Clean and format your data
3. Training Data - Model training & Building
4. Test Data - Test the Model using test data and evaluate
5. Model Deployment
