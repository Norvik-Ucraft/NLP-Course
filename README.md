## What is Spacy?
Spacy is open source Natural Language Processing Library, designed to effectively handle NLP tasks with the most efficient
implementation of common algorithms. For many NLP tasks, Spacy only has one implemented method, choosing the most efficient 
algorithms currently available, this means we often don't have the option to choose other algorithms.

Spacy works with a Pipeline object and the main idea here is that there is an `nlp()` function from spacy automatically 
takes raw text and performs a series of operations to tag, parse, and describe the text data.

## What is NLTK?
NLTK - Natural Language Toolkit is a very popular open source. It provides many functionalities, but includes less
efficient implementations.

## What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions
between computers and humans (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large 
amounts of natural language data. \
Natural Language Processing attempts to use a variety of techniques in order to create structure out of text data.

## Tokenization
The first step in processing text is to split up all the component parts (words & punctuation) into "tokens". These tokens
are annotated inside the Doc object to contain descriptive information.
